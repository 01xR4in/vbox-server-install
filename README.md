# vbox-server-install
A simple script that installs VirtualBox as a server

Install Script based on these articles :
- https://linuxiac.com/how-to-setup-and-manage-remote-virtualbox-headless-server/
- https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=60681

### Probably a bad idea to use this script as yet it needs :

- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Version detection
- [ ] Argument passing for easier configuration
- [ ] Proper documentation
