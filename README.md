# vbox-server-install
A simple script that installs VirtualBox as a server

Install Script based on these articles :
- https://linuxiac.com/how-to-setup-and-manage-remote-virtualbox-headless-server/
- https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?t=60681

### Probably a bad idea to use this script because
- Installing a type 2 hypervisor as server is just a bad idea
- Yet it still needs :
  - [ ] Error handling
  - [ ] Version detection
  - [ ] Argument passing for easier configuration
  - [ ] Proper documentation
